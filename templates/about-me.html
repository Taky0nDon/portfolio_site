    <p>Hi, thanks for checking out my portfolio! My name is Mike, and I'm a hyper passionate programmer.
    I'm 34 years old, and I've felt a powerful connection to computing ever since I was a little kid.
    I've been learning Python since February 2023, and have devoted many hours to increasing my knowledge of the craft.

    From online courses, to good old fashioned books, to binging on Primeagen videos
    and late nights tackling problems on CodeWars, I strived to get as much insight
    and knowledge from various sources as possible.

    It's been a challenge at time, but that's a big part of the reason it's been so rewarding.
    I loved the thrill of solving a problem and bending the digital world to my will.
    It has been an immensely rewarding experience learning to interact with them more directly.
    I found myself more capable of taking advantage of all the power a modern computer gives its user.
    Implementing the concepts and skills I've spent so much time learning has consistently kept me motivated 
    through the tough valleys of understanding.
    It was this incredible sensation of growth and accomplish which lead me to specialize more in back-end oriented programming.
